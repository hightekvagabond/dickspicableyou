(if you aren't my friend on facebook you can't see it, this is more for my own reference)

This is a repo for a phone app for responding to unsolicited pictures of a sexual nature.

Features I'd like to put in this app are:

Tag a text message as a dickpic and archive the picture and phone number the offender and then:
1) dress up the pic with costumes and send it back
2) add the pic to an archive of such pics and flag the number so your friends blast him with pics they've received
3) send a report for unwanted sexual harrassment to the authorities



To contribute:

Make sure you have Cordoba installed and the andriod and ios requirements:

Note: You aren't done installing requirements until you run "cordova requirements" and get all green

And ionic:

A note from a friend about how to do the blast:

 I think if you publish his info you can let the community take action like waze. Waze as a company could not get away with publishing where police are hiding but community can do it with out suffering legal action.

 Give your community resources like links to free pro subscriptions

 And push it all thru a no log VPN

 That was porn subscriptions
