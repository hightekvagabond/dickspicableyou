(if you aren't my friend on facebook you can't see it, this is more for my own reference)

This is a repo for a phone app for responding to unsolicited pictures of a sexual nature.

Features I'd like to put in this app are:

Tag a text message as a dickpic and archive the picture and phone number the offender and then:
1) dress up the pic with costumes and send it back
2) add the pic to an archive of such pics and flag the number so your friends blast him with pics they've received
3) send a report for unwanted sexual harrassment to the authorities
